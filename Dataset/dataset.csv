0,CN1.0.jpg,BB1,"After the customer buys a product electronically but cannot figure out how to use it, online technical support may be consulted. Another area in which e-commerce is widely used is access to financial insti- tutions. Many people already pay their bills, manage their bank accounts, and handle their investments electronically. This trend will surely continue as net- works become more secure. One area that virtually nobody foresaw is electronic flea markets (e-flea ). Online auctions of second-hand goods have become a massive industry. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which follows the client-server model, online auctions are peer-to-peer in the sense that consumers can act as both buyers and sellers. Some of these forms of e-commerce have acquired cute little tags based on the fact that ""to"" and ''2"" are pronounced the same. The most popular ones are listed in Fig. 4."
1,CN1.0.jpg,BB2,"Our fourth category is|entertainment.  This has made huge strides in the home in recent years, with the distribution of music, radio and television programs, and | movies over the Internet beginning to rival that of traditional mechanisms. Users can find, buy, and download MP3 songs and DVD-quality movies and add them to their personal collection. TV shows now reach many homes via IPTY_(IP TeleVision) systems that are based on IP technology instead of cable TV or radio transmissions. Media streaming applications let users tune into Internet radio sta- tions or watch recent episodes of their favorite TV shows. Naturally, all of this content can be moved around your house between different devices, displays and speakers, usually with a wireless network."
2,CN1.0.jpg,BB3,"Soon, it may be possible to search for any movie or television program ever made, in any country, and have it displayed on your screen instantly. New films may become interactive, where the user is occasionally prompted for the story direction (should Macbeth murder Duncan or just bide his time ) with alternative scenarios provided for all cases. Live television may also become interactive, with the audience participating in quiz shows, choosing among contestants, and so on."
3,CN1.1.jpg,BB1,"Connectivity to the Internet enables many of these mobile uses. Since having a wired connection is impossible in cars, boats, and airplanes, there is a lot of interest in wireless networks. Cellular networks operated by the telephone com- panies are one familiar kind of wireless network that blankets us with coverage for mobile phones. Wireless hotspots based on the 802.11 standard are another kind of wireless network for mobile computers. They have sprung up everywhere that people go, resulting in a patchwork of coverage at cafes, hotels, airports, schools, trains and planes. Anyone with a laptop computer and a wireless modem can just turn on their computer on and be connected to the Internet through the hotspot, as though the computer were plugged into a wired network."
4,CN1.1.jpg,BB2,"Wireless networks are of great value to fleets of trucks, taxis, delivery vehi- cles, and repairpersons for keeping in contact with their home base. For example, in many cities, taxi drivers are independent businessmen, rather than being them- ployees of a taxi company. In some of these cities, the taxis have a display the driver can see. When a customer calls up, a central dispatcher types in the pickup and destination points. This information is displayed on the drivers' displays and a beep sounds. The first driver to hit a button on the display gets the call. Wireless networks are also important to the military. If you have to be able to fight a war anywhere on Earth at short notice, counting on using the local net- working infrastructure is probably not a good idea. It is better to bring your own. Although wireless networking and mobile computing are often related, they are not identical, as Fig. 5 shows. Here we see a distinction between fixed wireless and mobile wireless networks. Even notebook computers are sometimes wired. For example, if a traveler plugs a notebook computer into the wired net- work jack in a hotel room, he has mobility without a wireless network."
5,CN1.1.jpg,BB3,"Conversely, some wireless computers are not mobile. In the home, and in offices or hotels that lack suitable cabling, it can be more convenient to connect desktop computers or media players wirelessly than to install wires. Installing a wireless network may require little more than buying a small box with some elec- tronics in it, unpacking it, and plugging it in, This solution may be far cheaper than having workmen put in cable ducts to wire the building. Finally, there are also true mobile, wireless applications, such as people walk- ing around stores with a handheld computers recording inventory. At many busy"
6,CN1.2.jpg,BB1,"Of course, this plan may backfire, since customers in a store might use the RFID or barcode readers on their mobile devices to check out competitors' prices before buying and use them to get a detailed report on where else an item can be pur- chased nearby and at what price. One huge thing that m-commerce has going for it is that mobile phone users are accustomed to paying for everything (in contrast to Internet users, who expect everything to be free). If an Internet Web site charged a fee to allow its customers to pay by credit card, there would be an immense howling noise from the users. If, however, a mobile phone operator its customers to pay for items in a store by waving the phone at the cash register and then tacked on a fee for this conveni- ence, it would probably be accepted as normal. Time will tell."
7,CN1.2.jpg,BB2,"No doubt the uses of mobile and wireless computers will grow rapidly in the future as the size of computers shrinks, probably in ways no one can now foresee. Let us take a quick look at some possibilities. The nodes may be part of familiar items such as cars or phones, or they may be small separate devices. For example, your car might gather data on its location, speed, vibration, and fuel efficiency from its on-board diagnostic system and upload this information to a database (Hull et al., 2006). Those data can help find potholes, plan trips around congested roads, and tell you if you are a ""gas guzzler"" compared to other drivers on the same stretch of road. Sensor networks are revolutionizing science by providing a wealth of data on behavior that could not previously be observed. One example is tracking the migration of individual zebras by placing a small sensor on each animal (Juang et al., 2002). Researchers have packed a wireless computer into a cube 1 mm on edge (Warneke et al., 2001). With mobile computers this small, even small birds, rodents, and insects can be tracked."
8,CN1.2.jpg,BB3,"Even mundane uses, such as in parking meters, can be significant because they make use of data that were not previously available. Wireless parking meters can accept credit or debit card payments with instant verification over the wireless link. They can also report when they are in use over the wireless network. This would let drivers download a recent parking map to their car so they can find an available spot more easily. Of course, when a meter expires, it might also check for the presence of a car (by bouncing a signal off it) and report the expiration to parking enforcement. It has been estimated that city governments in the you.S. alone could collect an additional $10 billion this way (Harte et al., 2000)."
9,CN1.2.jpg,BB4,"Wearable computers|are another promising application. Smart watches with radios have been part of our mental space since their appearance in the Dick Tracy comic strip in 1946; now you can buy them. Other such devices may be implanted, such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. Some of these can be con- trolled over a wireless network. This let us doctors test and reconfigure them more easily. It could also lead to some nasty problems if the devices are as insecure as the average PC and can be hacked easily (Halperin et al., 2008)."
10,CN1.3.jpg,BB1,"A set of layers and protocols is called a network architecture. The specif- ication of an architecture must contain enough information to allow an imple- menter to write the program or build the hardware for each layer so that it will correctly obey the appropriate protocol. Neither the details of the implementation nor the specification of the interfaces is part of the architecture because these are hidden away inside the machines and not visible from the outside. It is not even necessary that the interfaces on all machines in a network be the same, provided that each machine can correctly use all the protocols.|_A list of the protocols used by a certain system, one protocol per layer, is called a protocol stack. |"
11,CN1.3.jpg,BB2,"An analogy may help explain the idea of multilayer communication. 'Imagine two philosophers (peer processes in layer 3), one of whom speaks Urdu and English and one of whom speaks Chinese and French. Since they have no com- mon language, they each engage a translator (peer processes at layer 2), each of whom in tum contacts a secretary (peer processes in layer 1). Philosopher 1 wishes to convey his affection for oryctolagus cuniculus to his peer. To do so, he passes a message (in English) across the 2 3 interface to his translator, saying ""I like rabbits,""' as illustrated in Fig. 14. The translators have agreed on a neutral language known to both of them, Dutch, so the message is converted to ""Ik vind konijnen leuk."" The choice of the language is the layer 2 protocol and is up to the layer 2 peer processes."
12,CN1.3.jpg,BB3,"The translator then gives the message to a secretary for transmission, for ex- ample, by email (the layer 1 protocol). When the message arrives-at the other secretary, it is passed to the local translator, who translates it into French and passes it across the 2 3 interface to the second philosopher. Note that each proto- col is completely independent of the other ones as long as the interfaces are not changed. The translators can switch from Dutch to, say, Finnish, at will, provided that they both agree and neither changes his interface with either layer 1 or layer 3. Similarly, the secretaries can switch from email to telephone without disturb- ing (or even informing) the other layers. Each process may add some information intended only for its peer. This information is not passed up to the layer above."
13,CN1.3.jpg,BB4,"Now consider a more technical example: how to provide communication to the top layer of the five-layer network in Fi g. 15. A message, M, is produced by an application process running in layer 5 and given to layer 4 for transmission. --Layer 4 puts a header in front of the message to identify the message and passes the result to layer 3. The header includes control information, such as addresses, to allow layer 4 on the destination machine to deliver the message. Other ex- amples of control information used in some layers are sequence numbers (in case the lower layer does not preserve message order), sizes, and times. In many networks, no limit is placed on the size of messages transmitted in the layer 4 protocol but there is nearly always a limit imposed by the layer 3 pro- tocol. Consequently, layer 3 must break up the incoming messages into smaller"
14,CN1.4.jpg,BB1,"sender is often used. This subject is called flow control. Sometimes the problem is that the network is oversubscribed because too many. computers want to send too much traffic, and the network cannot deliver it all. This overloading of the network is called congestion. One strategy is for each computer to reduce its de- mand when it experiences congestion. It, too, can be used in all layers. It is interesting to observe that the network has more resources to offer than simply bandwidth. For uses such as carrying live video, the timeliness of delivery matters a great deal. Most networks must provide service to applications that want this real-time delivery at the same time that they provide service to applications that want high throughput. Quality of service is the name given to mechanisms that reconcile these competing demands.),\"
15,CN1.4.jpg,BB2,"The last major design issue is to secure the network by defending it against different kinds of threats. One of the threats we have mentioned previously is that of eavesdropping on communications. Mechanisms that provide confidentiality defend against this threat, and they are used in multiple layers. Mechanisms for authentication prevent someone from impersonating someone else. They might be used to tell fake banking Web sites from the real one, or to let the cellular net- work check that a call is really coming from your phone so that you will pay the bill. Other mechanisms for integrity prevent surreptitious changes to messages, such as altering ""debit my account $10"" to ""debit my account $1000."" All of these designs are based on cryptography."
16,CN1.4.jpg,BB3,"Layers can offer two different types of service to the layers above them: con- nection-oriented and connectionless. In this section we will look at these two types and examine the differences between them. Connection-oriented service is modeled after the telephone system. To talk to someone, you pick up the phone, dial the number, talk, and then hang up. LSimi- larly, to use a connection-oriented network service, the service user first estab- lishes a connection, uses the connection, and then releases the connection.} The essential aspect of a connection is that it acts like a tube: the sender pushes Objects (bits) in at one end, and the receiver takes them out at the other end. In most cases the order is preserved so that the bits arrive in the order they were sent."
17,CN1.4.jpg,BB4,"In some cases when a connection is established, the sender, receiver, and sub- net conduct a negotiation about the parameters to be used, such as maximum message size, quality of service required, and other issues. Typically, one side makes a proposal and the other side can accept it, reject it, or make a counter- proposal. [A circuit is another name for a connection with associated resources, such as a fixed bandwidth. This dates from the telephone network in which a cir- cuit was a path over coppef wire that carried a phone conversation. In contrast to connection-oriented service, PSonnectionless service is modeled after the postal system.| Each message (letter) carries the full destination address,"
18,OS1.0.jpg,BB1,"Another type of multiprocessor system is a clustered system, which gathers together multiple CPUs. Clustered systems differ from the multiprocessor systems described in Section 1.3.2 in that they are composed of two or more individual systems -- or nodes --joined together. Such systems are considered loosely coupled. Each node may be a single processor system or a multicore system. We should note that the definition of clustered is not concrete; many commercial packages wrestle to define a clustered system and why one form is better than another. The generally accepted definition is that clustered computers share storage and are closely linked via a local-area network LAN ora faster interconnect, such as InfiniBand."
19,OS1.0.jpg,BB2,"Clustering is usually used to provide high-availability service--that is, service will continue even if one or more systems in the alacter fail. Generally, we obtain high availability by adding a level of redundancy in the system. A layer of cluster software runs on the cluster nodes. Each node can monitor one or more of the others (over the LAN). If the monitored machine fails, the monitoring machine can take ownership of its storage and restart the applications that were running on the failed machine. The users and clients of the applications see only a brief interruption of service."
20,OS1.0.jpg,BB3,"Clustering can be structured asymmetrically or symmetrically. In asymmet- ric clustering, one machine is in hge-Sstandby mode while the other is running the applications.[The hot-standby host machine does nothing but monitor the active server.|[f that server fails, the hot-standby host becomes the active server. In eee two or more hosts are running applications and are monitoring each other. This structure is obviously more efficient, as it uses all of the available hardware. However it does require that more than one application be available to run."
21,OS1.0.jpg,BB4,"vince a cluster consists of several computer systems connected via a network, clusters can also be used to provide high-performance computing environments. Such systems can supply significantly greater computational power than single-processor or even SMP systems because they can run an application concurrently on all computers in the cluster. The application must have been written specifically to take advantage of the cluster, however. This involves a technique known as parallelization, which divides a rogram into Separate components that run in parallel on individual computers in the cluster. Typically, these applications are designed so that once each computing node in the cluster has solved its portion of the problem, the results from all the nodes are combined into a final solution."
22,OS1.0.jpg,BB5,"Other forms of clusters include parallel clusters and clustering over a wide-area network (WAN)LParallel clusters allow multiple hosts to access the Same data on shared storage. Recause most operating systems lack support for Simultaneous data access by Multiple hosts, parallel clusters usually require the use of special versions of software and special releases of applications. For example, Oracle Real Application Cluster is a version of Oracle's database that has been designed to run ona parallel cluster. Each machine runs Oracle, and a layer of software tracks access to the shared disk. Each machine has full access to all data in the database. To provide this shared access, the system must also supply access control and locking to ensure that no conflicting operations"
23,OS1.1.jpg,BB1,"Now that we have discussed basic computer-system organization and archi- tecture, we are ready to talk about operating systems. An operating system provides the environment within which programs are executed. Internally, operating systems vary greatly in their makeup, since they are organized along many different lines. There are, however, many commonalities, which we consider in this section."
24,OS1.1.jpg,BB2,"One of the most important aspects of operating systems is the ability to multiprogram. A single program cannot, in general, keep either the CPU or the 1 O devices busy at all times. Single users frequently have multiple programs running. 'Viu!tiprogramming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs (code and data) so that the CPU always has one to execute. The idea is as follows: The operating system keeps several jobs in memory simultaneously (Figure 1.9). Since, in general, main memory is too small to accommodate all jobs, the jobs are kept initially on the disk in the jgb_poo!. This poo} consists of all processes residing on disk awaiting allocation of main memory."
25,OS1.1.jpg,BB3,"The set of jobs in memory can be a subset of the jobs kept in the job pool. The operating system picks and begins to execute one of the jobs in memory. Eventually, the job may have to wait for some task, such as an I O operation, to complete. In a non-multiprogrammed system, the CPU would sit idle. In a multiprogrammed system, the operating system simply switches to, and executes, another job. When that job needs to wait, the CPU switches to another job, and so on, Eventually, the first job finishes waiting and gets the CPU back. As long as at least one job needs to execute, the CPU is never idle. ="
26,OS1.1.jpg,BB4,"This idea is common in other life situations. A lawyer does not work for only one client at a time, for example. While one case is waiting to go to trial or have papers typed, the lawyer can work on another case. If he has enough clients, the lawyer will never be idle for lack of work. (Idle lawyers tend to become politicians, so there is a certain social value in keeping lawyers busy.)"
27,OS1.2.jpg,BB1,"components. We should note that, as an alternative to modes, the CPU designer may use other methods to differentiate operational privileges. The Intel 64 family of CPUs supports four privilege levels, for example, and supports virtualization but does not have a separate mode for virtualization. We can now see the life cycle of instruction execution ina computer system. Initial control resides in the operating system, where instructions are executed in kernel mode. When control is given to a user application, the mode is set to user mode. Eventually, control is switched back to the operating system via an inteyfupt, a trap, or a system call."
28,OS1.2.jpg,BB2,"Z{System calls provide the means for a user program to ask the operating system to perform tasks reserved for the Operating system on the user pro- gram's behalf. A system call is invoked in a variety of ways, depending on the functionality provided by the underlying processor. In all forms, it is the method used by a process to request action by the operating system. A system call usually takes the form of a trap to a specific location in the interrupt -- This trap can be executed by a generic trap instruction, although some systems (sugh as MIPS) have a specific syscal1 instruction to invoke a system call. TA ae a ome _ ee i i a"
29,OS1.2.jpg,BB3,"When a system call is executed, it is typically treated by the hardware as_a_software interrupt. Control passes through the interrupt vector to a service routine in the operating system, and the mode bit is set to kernel mode. The system-call service routine is a part of the operating system. The kernel examines the interrupting instruction to determine what system call has occurred; a parameter indicates what type of service the user program is requesting. Additional information needed for the request may be passed in registers, on the stack, or in memory (with pointers to the memory locations passed in registers). The kernel verifies that the parameters are correct and legal, executes the n d returns control to the instruction following the system call. We describe system calls more fully in Section 2.3."
30,OS1.2.jpg,BB4,"The lack of a hardware-supported dual mode can because serious shortcom- ings in an operating system. For instance, MS-DOS was written for the Intel 8088 architecture, which has no mode bit and therefore no dual mode. A user Program running awry can wipe out the operating system by writing over it with data; and multiple programs are able to write to a device at the same time, with potentially disastrous results. Modern versions of the Intel CPU do provide dual-mode operation. Accordingly, most contemporary Operating systems--such as Microsoft Windows 7, as well as Unix and Linux--take advantage of this dual-mode feature and provide greater protection for the operating system."
31,OS1.2.jpg,BB5,"Once hardware protection is in place, it detects errors that violate modes. These errors are normally handled by the operating system. If a user program fails in some way --such as by making an attempt either to execute an illegal instruction or to access memory that is not in the user's address space-- then the hardware traps to the operating system. The trap transfers control through the interrupt vector to the operating system, just as an interrupt does. When a program error occurs, the operating system must terminate the Program abnormally. This situation is handled by the same code as a user- requested abnormal termination. An appropriate error message is given, and the memory of the program may be dumped. The memory dump is usually written to a file so that the user or programmer can examine it and perhaps Correct it and restart the program."
32,OS1.3.jpg,BB1,"The movement of information between levels of a storage hierarchy may be either explicit or implicit, depending on the hardware design and the controlling operating-system software. For instance, data transfer from cache to CPU and registers is usually a hardware function, with no operating-system intervention. In contrast, transfer of data from disk to memory is usually controlled by the operating system."
33,OS1.3.jpg,BB2,"In a hierarchical storage structure, the same data may appear in different levels of the storage system. For example, suppose that an integer A that is to be incremented by 1 is located in file B, and file B resides on magnetic disk. The increment operation proceeds by first issuing an [ O operation to copy the disk block on which A resides to main memory. This operation is followed by copying A to the cache and to an internal register. Thus, the copy of A appears in several places: on the magnetic disk, in main memory, in the cache, and in an internal register (see Figure 1.12). Once the increment takes place in the internal register, the value of A differs in the various storage systems. The value of A becomes the same only after the new value of A is written from the internal register back to the magnetic disk."
34,OS1.3.jpg,BB3,"In a computing environment where only one process executes at a time, this arrangement poses no difficulties, since an access to integer A will always be to the copy at the highest level of the hierarchy. However, in a multitasking environment, where the CPU is switched back and forth among various pro- cesses, extreme care must be taken to ensure that, if several processes wish to access A, then each of these processes will obtain the most recently updated value of A."
35,OS1.3.jpg,BB4,"The situation becomes more complicated in a multiprocessor environment where, in addition to maintaining internal registers, each of the CPUs also contains a local cache (Figure 1.6). In such an environment, a copy of A may exist simultaneously in several caches. Since the various CPUs can all execute in parallel, we must make sure that an update to the value of A in one cache is immediately reflected in all other caches where A resides. This situation is called cache coherency, and it is usually a hardware issue (handled below the operating-system level)."
36,OS1.3.jpg,BB5,"ee ee se eee or eee In a distributed environment, the situation becomes even more complex. In this environment, several copies (or replicas) of the same file can be kept on different computers. Since the various replicas may be accessed and updated concurrently, some distributed systems ensure that, when a replica is updated in one place, all other replicas are brought up to date as soon as possible."
37,OS1.4.jpg,BB1,"A tree is a data structure that can be used to represent data hierarchically. Data values in a tree structure are linked through parent-child relationships. In a general tree, a parent may have an unlimited number of children. In a binary tree, a parent may have at most two children, which we term the left child and the right child. Abinary search tree additionally requires an ordering between the parent's two children in which left_child <= right child. Figure 1.16 provides an example of a binary search tree. When we search for an item in a binary search tree, the worst-case performance is O(n) (consider how this can occur). To remedy this situation, we can use an algorithm to create a balanced binary search tree. Here, a tree containing n items has at most  g n levels, thus ensuring worst-case performance of O(lg n). We shall see in Section 5.7.1 that Linux uses a balanced binary search tree as part its CPU-scheduling algorithm."
38,OS1.4.jpg,BB2,"A hash function takes data as its input, performs a numeric operation on this data, and returns a numeric value. This numeric value can then be used as an index into a table (typically an array) to quickly retrieve the data. Whereas searching for a data item through a list of size n can require up to O(n) comparisons in the worst case, using a hash function for retrieving data from table can be as good as O(1) in the worst case, depending on implementation details. Because of this performance, hash functions are used ex tensively in operating systems."
39,SE1.0.jpg,BB1,"the actors involved in an interaction and names the type of interaction! This is then supplemented by additional information describing the interaction with the system. additional information may be a textual description or one or more graphical models such as UML sequence or state charts, Use cases are documented using a high-level use case diagram. The set of use cases represents all of the possible interactions that will be described in the system requirements. Actors in the process, who may be human or other systems, are repre- sented as stick figures. Each class of interaction is represented as a named ellipse. Lines link the actors with the interaction. Optionally, arrowheads may be added to lines to show how the interaction is initiated. This is illustrated in Figure 15, which shows some of the use cases for the patient information system."
40,SE1.0.jpg,BB2,"There is no hard and fast distinction between scenarios and use cases. Some peo- ple consider that each use case is a single scenario; others, as suggested by Stevens and Pooley (2006), encapsulate a set of scenarios in a single use case. Each scenario is a single thread through the use case. Therefore, there would be a scenario for the normal interaction plus scenarios for each possible exception. You can, in practice, use, them in either way. Use cases identify the individual interactions between the system and its users or other systems, Bach use case should be documented with a textual description. These can then be linked to other models in the UML that will develop the scenario in more detail. For example, a brief description of the Setup Consultation use case from Figure 15 might be:"
41,SE1.0.jpg,BB3,"Setup consultation allows two or more doctors, working in different offices, to view the same record at the same time. One doctor initiates the consultation by choosing the people involved from a drop-down menu of doctors who are on- line. The patient record is then displayed on their screens but only the initiating doctor can edit the record. In addition, a text chat window is created to help"
42,SE1.1.jpg,BB1,"The definition of a system boundary is not a value-free judgment. Social and organizational concerns may mean that the position of a system boundary may be determined by non-technical factors. For example{a system boundary may be delib- erately positioned so that the analysis process can all be carried out on one site; it may be chosen so that a particularly difficult manager need not be consulted; it may be positioned so that the system cost is increased and the system development divi- sion must therefore expand to design and implement the system. Once some decisions on the boundaries of the system have been made, part of the analysis activity is the definition of that context and the dependencies that a system has on its environment. Normally, producing a simple architectural mi is the step in this activity."
43,SE1.1.jpg,BB2,"Figure | is a simple context model that shows the patient information system and the other systems in its environment. From Figure 1, you can see that the MHC-PMS is connected to an appointments system and a more general patient record system with which it shares data. The system is also connected to systems for management reporting and hospital bed allocation and a statistics system that collects information for research. Finally, it makes use of a prescription system to generate prescriptions for patients' medication."
44,SE1.1.jpg,BB3,"Context models normally show that the environment includes several other auto- mated systems. However, they do not show the types of relationships between the systems in the environment and the system that is being specified. External systems might produce data for or consume data from the system. They might share data with the system, or they might be connected directly, through a network or not connected at all. They might be physically co-located or located in separate buildings. All of these relations may affect the requirements and design of the system being defined and must be taken into account. Therefore, simple context models are used along with other models, such as business process models. These describe human and automated processes in which particular software systems are used."
45,SE1.2.jpg,BB1,"Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system. In the model of the soft- ware development process, architectural design is the first stage in the software design process. It is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the relationships between them. The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components."
46,SE1.2.jpg,BB2,"In agile processes, it is generally accepted that an early stage of the development process should be concerned with establishing an overall system architecture. Incremental development of architectures is not usually successful. While refactor- ing components in response to changes is usually relatively easy, refactoring a sys- tem architecttire is likely to be expensive."
47,SE1.2.jpg,BB3,"To help you understand what I mean by system architecture, consider Figure |}. This shows an abstract model of the architecture for a packing robot system that shows the components that have to be developed. This robotic systern can pack dif- ferent kinds of object. It uses a vision component to pick out objects on a conveyor, identify the type of object, and select the right kind of packaging. The system then moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be packaged. It places packaged objects on another conveyor. The architectural model shows these components and the links between them."
48,SE1.2.jpg,BB4,"In practice, there is a significant overlap between the processes of requirements engineering and architectural design. Ideally, a system specification should not include any design information. This is unrealistic except for very small systems. Architectural decomposition is usually necessary to structure and organize the spec- ification. Therefore, as part of the requirements engineering process, you might pro- pose an abstract system architecture where you associate groups of system functions or features with large-scale components or sub-systems. You can then use this decomposition to discuss the requirements and features of the system with stake- holders."
49,SE1.3.jpg,BB1,"those invoices that have been paid, a receipt is issued. For those invoices that have not been paid within the allowed payment time, a reminder is issued. Interactive systems are difficult to write using the pipe and filter model because of the need for a stream of data to be processed. Although simple textual input and output can be modeled in this way, graphical user interfaces have more complex V O formats and a control strategy that is based on events such as mouse clicks or menu selections. It is difficult to translate this into a form compatible with the pipelining model."
50,SE1.3.jpg,BB2,"Application systems are intended to meet a business or organizational need. All busi- nesses have much in common--they need to hire people, issue invoices, keep accounts, and so on. Businesses operating in the same sector use common sector- specific applications. Therefore, as well as general business functions, all phone companies need systems to connect calls, manage their network, issue bills to customers, etc. Consequently, the application systems used by these businesses also have much in common."
51,SE1.3.jpg,BB2,"These commonalities have led to the development of software architectures that describe the structure and organization of particular types of software sys- tems. Application architectures encapsulate the principal characteristics of a class of systems. For example, in real-time systems, there might be generic archi- tectural models of different system types, such as data collection systems or monitoring systems. Although instances of these systems differ in detail, the common architectural structure can be reused when developing new systems of the same type."
52,SE1.3.jpg,BB3,"The application architecture may be re-implemented when developing new systems but, for many business systems, application reuse is possible without re- implementation. We see this in the growth of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems from companies such as SAP and Oracle, and vertical software packages (COTS) for specialized applications in different areas of business. In these systems, a generic system is configured and adapted to create a specific business application."
53,SE1.4.jpg,BB1,"One of the most important benefits of test-driven development is that it reduces the costs of regression testing Regression testing involves running test sets that have successfully executed after changes have been made to a system] The regression test checks that these changes have not | introduced new bugs into the system and that the new code interacts as expected with the existing code. Regression testing is very expensive and often impractical when a system is manually tested, as the costs in time and effort are very high. In such situations, you have to try and choose the most relevant tests to re-run and it is easy to miss important tests."
54,SE1.4.jpg,BB2,"However, automated testing, which is fundamental to test-first development, dra- matically reduces the costs of ssion testing. Existing tests may be re-run quickly and cheaply. After making a change to a system in test-first development, all existing tests must run successfully before any further functionality is added. As a programmer, you can be confident that the new functionality that you have added has not caused or revealed problems with existing code."
55,SE1.4.jpg,BB3,"Test-driven development is of most use in new software development where the functionality is either implemented in new code or by using well-tested standard libraries. [If you are reusing large code components or legacy systems then you need to write tests for these systems as a whol {Test-driven development may also be ineffective with multi-threaded systems} The different threads may be interleaved at different times in different test runs, and so may produce different results."
56,SE1.4.jpg,BB4,"If you use test-driven development, you still need a system testing process to val- idate the system; that is, to check that it meets the requirements of all of the system stakeholders. A also tests performance, reliability, and checks that the system does not do things that it should not do, such as produce unwanted outputs, etc. Andrea (2007) suggests how testing tools can be extended to integrate some aspects of system testing with TDD. Test-driven development has proved to be a successful approach for small and medium-sized pects Geeals programmers who have adopted this approach are happy with it and find it a more productive way to develop software (Jeffries and"
57,ST1.0.jpg,BB1,"The worldwide situation concerning resource consumption and environmental impact of human actions becomes more apparent when looking at the development of the world population and the world energy consumption. Both entered a steep increase at around 1900, growing steeper and faster. While the world population has tripled in about 100 years, we consumed around the year 2000 around 15 times the amount of energy compared to 1900 . This growth based development of the recent decades has caused various environmental threats such as pollution, acid rain, deforestation, destruction of the ozone layer, climate change, etc. Therefore, this is a need for sustainable development. The sustainable technologies used to achieve the same would focus on the three basic dimensions of sustainability, i.e., the environment, the economy and the society. The same has been illustrated in Figure 1 which describes how these dimensions of sustainability are related to each other."
58,ST1.0.jpg,BB2,"Sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability Research, an interdisciplinary and applied science field, concerns with the research in sustainability solutions and their implementation. The most important requirement in the context of sustainability science is the need for new paradigms and disciplines in order to master the challenge of sustainable development."
59,ST1.0.jpg,BB3,"Sustainability science and computational sustainability are related fields. Computational sustainability has to do with the use of computational technologies and computational thinking in furtherance of sustainability, and the related matter of reducing the adverse environmental impacts of computing technologies themselves. However, most of the time the consequences of technology cannot be predicted early in the life of a technology. Instead, the consequences are discovered over time, but, unfortunately, by that time they are often already so much part of the economy and social fabric, that its control is difficult. ""When change is easy, the need for control cannot be foreseen, but when the need for change becomes apparent, it has become expensive, difficult and time consuming"" ."
60,ST1.1.jpg,BB1,Short-term Photovoltaic Power Prediction with Statistical learning An increase in need for alternate sources of energy has prompted the utilization of the energy from the sun. Photovoltaic cells present in the solar panels are used to absorb the energy from the sun and convert into electrical energy. Solar Panels have found their usage in small homes to large power plants. The power generated can vary greatly depending on the angle of incidence of the sunlight and the potential of the cell to effectively convert energy with very low loss.
61,ST1.1.jpg,BB2,"Therefore, this power prediction algorithm uses different statistical learning algorithms to predict the power or energy that is generated. However, due to changing weather conditions, e.g. clouds and fog, a precise forecast in a few hour range can be a difficult task."
62,ST1.2.jpg,BB1,"Renewable Energy Prediction for Improved Utilization and Efficiency in Datacenters Datacenters are one of the most important global energy consumers and carbon producers. However, their tight service level requirements prevent easy integration with highly variable renewable resources. Short-term green energy prediction can mitigate this variability. Datacenters include computing systems (servers and related hardware), networking systems, power supply and management systems, as well as cooling systems to remove the heat produced in the computing units and maintain the temperature of the data center at a level suitable for humans as well as machines. All these systems in a data center require energy and contribute to sustainability concerns in different ways. Hence, aiming to balance the reliability, cost, and carbon emissions of a data center is challenging."
63,ST1.2.jpg,BB2,"Prediction of Environmental Fate of Products using Hybrid Machine Learning Prediction of the environmental fate of products, i.e., their degradation products and pathways of organic environmental pollutants. One of the main tasks in the chemical industry regarding the sustainability of a product is the prediction of its environmental fate, i.e., its degradation products and pathways. Current methods for the prediction of biodegradation products and pathways of organic environmental pollutants either do not take into account domain knowledge or do not provide probability estimates. A list of rules and their descriptions used for the prediction of end product of a given compound is mentioned in Table 1. Referring to Table 1. for each transformation rule triggered by the amitraz compound, an example product is shown in the Figure 6. Some of the transformation rules can produce more than one product from this structure. Applying random forest classifier to the structure resulted in the probabilities for the formation of each product respectively. From the transformation predicted, only bt0063 produces a known product with a relatively high predicted probability."

Initially, data pre-processing and feature extraction components of the Inline Quality Prediction System are performed. Following this, a combination of supervised and unsupervised data mining methods is applied to identify most striking operational patterns, promising quality-related features and production parameters. The results indicate how sustainable and energy-efficient interlinked manufacturing processes can be achieved by the application of data mining."
65,ST1.3.jpg,BB2,"Therefore, the main goal is to identify quality deviations as early as possible and in real-time by data mining on distributed sensor measurements along the process chain. To perform this a SOM is used. The Self Organizing Map (SOM) achieves a clustering and a dimensionality reduction by mapping input vectors from a higher dimensional continuous space to a fixed number of points (neurons) on a lower dimensional grid as indicated in the Figure 8."
